# Rust Ceramic

Implementation of the Ceramic protocol in Rust.

Current status is that the `ceramic-one` binary only mimics the Kubo RPC API and relies on https://github.com/ceramicnetwork/js-ceramic for the remaining logic.

## Usage

Run in single binary using the `ceramic-one` crate:

    $ cargo run -p ceramic-one -- daemon

The process honors RUST_LOG env variable for controlling its logging output.
For example, to enable debug logging for code from this repo but error logging for all other code use:

    $ RUST_LOG=ERROR,ceramic_kubo_rpc=DEBUG,ceramic_one=DEBUG cargo run -p ceramic-one -- daemon
